# Dr.Angela_Yu_WebDevBootCamp

This is a compilation of all the projects that i did during the web development bootcamp.

The projects are placed according to the topic taught.

This does not mean previous topics were ignored.

The previous topics were pre-written to focus on the currently taught topic(a very good technique of Angela).

I am sharing this via my public repository so that it can display the work i've done during this bootcamp.

Two projects are games to learn CSS flex and grid. They are not created by me(reason why only links are provided).
