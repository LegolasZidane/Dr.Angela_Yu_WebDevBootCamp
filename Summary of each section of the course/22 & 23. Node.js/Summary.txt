Since Backend Development was a just introduction, so i decided to merge it with Node.js's summary.

In the intro, server, application and database were briefly discussed and how they work together. Also some technologies related to them were discussed.

In the Node.js section, we learnt why we are using a framework like node.js, what benefits do we get, different node modules, and a lot more.

Finally we did a QR Code project which was really fascinating as we completed it by looking at documentation of various packages.

Scan the QR to go to Youtube.com(You can change this by pasting any URL in the URL.txt file and running the code from the projects folder).
