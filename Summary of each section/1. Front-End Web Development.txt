Started this course on April 26th.

I feel you have to do the first part, no matter how trivial it is like this section.

Learnt how the world is connected with underwater cables which can be seen online.

Cornell note taking system which i never used. I prefer to write my notes on a word file, and then later copy it on a notebook for revision.

Learnt how to "Ask a Question" which is quite useful, now that i think of it.
